    <p id="proj1_desc">This was the first informational website I created for my preliminary <br>project in my third year's first semester at Southville. I utilized HTML, <br>CSS, and JavaScript for this project. The site features five different <br>pages, as shown in the screenshots. You begin at the login page, and <br>if you log in as a Regular User, you will see the standard color scheme<br> of the random Pokémon assigned by our professor. If the user logs in<br> as a Shiny User, the website will display the shiny version's color <br>scheme of the Pokémon. Additionally, this website incorporates jQuery<br> animations that I implemented for buttons and page transitions.</p>

    <p id="proj2_desc">This was a project I developed during my second year, featuring an<br> 8-bit binary game where the player inputs their name to get started. <br>Players are presented with a number that they must convert into binary<br> before the timer expires. As shown in the screenshot, my design follows<br> an ice cream theme. If the binary value is 0, the ice cream cone appears <br>empty, but a value of 1 indicates that the cone has a scoop of ice cream. <br>Once the time is up, the player's score is displayed on the leaderboard<br> along with their total playtime.</p>
